            <h2>Beau Greaves only picked up a dart three years ago, but has already been making a big impression.</h2>

            <p>“GAME, SHOT AND THE MATCH... BEAU GREAVES!” </p>

            <p>It’s a very familiar story for the 13-year-old from Doncaster. The hottest prospect in women’s darts has become the talk of the sport as her ever growing profile is pushing her further into the limelight. </p>


            <h3> <i>Starting young</i> </h3>

            <p>After her latest win at the Welsh Open last weekend, it adds another honour to her ever-growing trophy cabinet. </p>

            <p>But it all started three years ago for Beau, who picked up her first set of tungsten after watching her older brother Taylor play in his bedroom. Since then, she has never looked back.
</p>

            </figure>
            <p>After her first three darts, Taylor, 20, was astounded by what he saw and called their parents to watch. </p>

            <p>Her mother Tracy, 50, didn't realise the talent her daughter had. She said: “At first you just go ‘oh yeah sure’ but he was insistent. When we saw how good she was, we couldn’t believe it."" </p>

            <p>The talented teenager has since risen to the pinnacle of the youth game for girls, representing England and is the current Welsh Open and Europe Cup winner.</p>

              <figure>
              <p> <img src="images/tournamentwins.jpg" alt="Beau has had quite the career so far" class="center"</p>
              </figure>

              <p>Her success would make any parent proud, but her father Dave, 59, is keen to ensure she remains grounded.</p>

              <p>He said: “We don’t pressure Beau to play. If she wants to play, she can. If she wanted to stop playing tomorrow, that’s fine by us.”"</p>

              <p>The relaxed attitude obviously runs in the family.</p>

              <p>"One time, they were calling her name before a final, and she was nowhere to be seen," recalls her mum Tracy. "When we found her, she was playing on the ice hockey machines!"</p>

              <p>However Beau approaches games, it's working so far for her.</p>

              <blockquote>
                  "I had to join a men's league because there was no women to play" <br> ~ <em>Beau</em>
              </blockquote>

              <p>Having already beaten current world champion Lisa Ashton and world number 7 Fallon Sherrock, Beau boasts an impressive string of victories under her belt.</p>

              <p>She said: “I played Lisa (Ashton) and beat her, then I played Fallon Sherrock and beat her 4-0. All in one day. I beat Paula Jacklin 4-1 too. I may have beaten (world number one) Deta Hedman that day as well. I’m not sure.”</p>

            <h2>Women's darts is still quite the difference behind the men's game</h2>

            <div style="clear: left;">
    <p style="float: left;"><img src="images/infogr.jpg" padding=""  border="20em"></p>
    <p style="float: right;"><Text Text Text Text Text Text Text Text Text Text Text Text Text Text Text Text Text Text Text</p>
</div>

            <p>
                Over the years women’s darts has suffered a series of setbacks, with only a handful of professionals being able to make a living out of the game.
            </p>

            <p>
                As the beer-belly pub image still surrounds the sport, it still lacks the appeal in convincing females to take up the darts that is still largely set around its male participants.
            </p>

            <p>There have been attempts from the PDC to endorse the women's game to the level of the thriving men's, but a "Women's World Championship" flopped dramatically in 2010."

            </p>

            <p>The 2010 edition was the first and last held by the PDC, and was held 6 months prior to the prestigious men's event, as well as being an almost afterthought on a men's headline tournament.</p>

            <p>Whereas the men's final is the crowning jewel of the PDC calendar and concludes on new year's day, the 2010 women's edition played second fiddle to the men's World Matchplay in the middle of June</p>

            <p>
                The first Women’s world championship was in 2001, 23 years after the inaugural men’s event where Leighton Rees cemented himself in darting history.
            </p>

            <p>
              The tournament was launched to enhance the female game, however it never really took off.

            </p>

             <p>The prize money comparison also leaves a lot to be desired, as Lisa Ashton won £12,000 in 2017.
              </p>

              <p> Eric Bristow won the same amount back in 1986, and with the lack of prize money on offer, it means that the female players cannot subsidise themselves from their earnings alone.
               </p>

               <p>It remains to be seen whether Beau can be the player that breaks the mould and puts women's darts on the map, but wih the accolades she has won to date, she's made a pretty good case so far. .
                </p>
